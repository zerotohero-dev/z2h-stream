How to run this app:

* Run `parcel index.html` at the project root.
* Make sure you have a `unicorn.png` file in the `./dist` folder 
  (*you can copy it from the folder where this README resides in*)

That should be it :)

Ah, also don't forget to install `parcel` globally.

See <https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html>.
