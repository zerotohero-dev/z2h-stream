Hi there 🙋,

streams](https://twitch.tv/ZeroToHeroDev), and what’s coming up next.

⚡ I update this log after the end of each stream.

📅 My current schedule is (*all times are Pacific*):

* **Tuesday**, *6pm–7:30pm*
* **Thursday**, *6pm–7:30pm*
* **Sunday**, *12pm–1:30pm*

💡 [Follow me on **Twitch** to get notified as soon as I’m

Enjoy, and may the source be with you 🦄,

Volkan.
